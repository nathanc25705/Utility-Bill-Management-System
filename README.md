# Utility-Bill-Management-System

A Command Line Interface system that will records utility bill details and together with a menu generates queries/reports that can be run against this data.

This interface satisifes the following requirements:

1.	Provide a way for a user to enter utility bill details: utility company, name of the customer, date of the bill, the amount, and a flag indicating whether the bill is debit or credit.
2.	Start your code with the initial bills.csv above.  However, you need to provide a mechanism for writing and reading these utility bills to a text file.
This option should be provided via a menu choice.
3.	Provide a report that lists years, total credited and total debited, e.g., the output will look like the following:
4.	
Year		Total Credited	Total Debited

2016		€123.45		€678.90

2017		€543.21		€987.60

4.	Provide a report that shows the most popular utility company.  The most popular utility company is the one with the most bills against that provider.
5.	Provide a report that shows the bills in date order.
6.	Provide another report that displays the highest amount for a bill that is a credit, and one for a debit.
7.	Provide a report to indicate how successful the company is.  This should display the total number of bills.
8.	Provide a report to calculate the average spent per period of time (month/year) that can be entered by the user.
9.	Provide a report to calculate the average time between bills.
